AI Learning Companion
---------------------
This is a mini project where I tried combining Computer Vision, OCR and NLP.
You can upload an image and the app will:

detect objects (YOLOv8)

extract text (Tesseract OCR)

classify the image as text/diagram/mixed (CNN)

understand what the user wants like explain/summary/quiz (LSTM)

show everything in a Streamlit UI

Tech Used : Python, TensorFlow/Keras, YOLOv8, OpenCV, PyTesseract, Streamlit

Note : This is still experimental and I’ll improve it as I go.
